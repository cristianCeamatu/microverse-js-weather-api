# Bible Talks social web app built in rails with user registration and creation of talks(tweets)/follow/unfollow users.

> In this project, we were required to build a social app where users can sign-up/sign-in/sign out, create talks(tweets), and follow/unfollow other users. The project enforced our skills in using most of the core functionalities of the Rails framework.
> <br>
> The app is mobile responsive and users can <b>sign up/sign in with their Github and Twitter accounts</b>. Users can upload a profile and cover images at the sign-up or after they sign in by accessing the profile page, here they can also edit their username and full name.
> <br>
> The app is tested using RSpec for unit and integration tests
